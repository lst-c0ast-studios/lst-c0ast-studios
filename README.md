- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm A.D.C. I don't watch television or play games. This is my personal page. I work at and own a small portable art studio @lst-c0ast-studios. I'm a writer and private researcher. Currently I'm in the process of designing a series of languages.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in positive and beneficial social connections! I study morphology! I really enjoy patching audio using modular system setups to design my own "wavetable" systems. I'm a professional audio engineer and illusionist! I occasionally write code and I run a paid service for audio dubs, mixing & mastering, audio remixes, audio edits, general performance booking, instrumental performances, promotions, photography, art, comics, security and many other things! I am currently working on some books at the moment. Here is a list of subjects I've intimately studied in no particular order - Traditional medicine, sociology, computer science, the arts, economics, business, anthropology, philosophy, theology, the occult, government, phonetics, literature, comedy, history, advertising in psychology, sound design, production in multimedia, telecommunications and radio science, learning theory, law, mycology, dendrology, general field identification and foraging, technology in research and development, psychology, hypnosis, neuroscience, cyber security, systems theory, civil and social engineering, cryptography, theoretical physics, current social affairs...

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about hyperdimensional communications sub-systems and the roles they have in socio-economic, multimedia outlets, civil and military research developments as well as how they affect education and legislation for the people's practical application and how these practices' functionalities affect the complex nature of morphology contained therein the english lexicon of my relative and distant locale's sub-categorization. How international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium are affected is a constant differential within this very broad and complex study.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for like-minded individuals who aren't religiously toxic. As a writer, I look for people who push the boundaries of poetry and literature, classical method and theory. As a programmer, I want to read your code. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are and spend meaningful time with you if we're compatible. As a businessman, I am always looking for quality talent to work with. If I were to run for a position in the field of governance, I would seek to propagate balanced and pragmatic leadership in order to oppose stagnation in legislative idiosynchronicities within various branches.
