- üëã Hi, I work at and own a small independent portable studio called lst_c0ast_studios. That's pronounced "Last Coast Studios" in case you were wondering. I am also a private developer an author and I am currently working on a book at the moment. Currently I'm in the process of developing a few languages for use in information and cryptography. I've designed three languages, two of which are unique and have been in a rigorous testing phase. I test many other things on my own time for private research i.e. web design, infrastructure, security, various systems, networks and so on. 

- I started an account on github to welcome open interaction and to have a grounds for study. I have experience with advanced hardware and software that I would love to talk about if you have the time. I'm also an artist and a professional audio engineer. When I'm not writing or working on developing code, I run a service dedicated to audio. Custom hardware builds, setups and takedowns, repairs, testing, live audio dubbing, post-production, ghostwriting, edits, mixing, mastering, booking, radio and so on. lst_c0ast_studios has dedicated sessions musicians and networks with many bright, multi-faceted and talented individuals.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in positive and mutually beneficial connections that can bring about positive change for all parties involved.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about hyperdimensional communications systems, what roles they have in society, how they impact socio-economic development, multimedia design, civil and military infrastructure, as well as education and legislation. On that note, I've found that hyperdimensional communications affect the complex nature of morphology contained therein the english lexicon of my relative and distant locale. How international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium are affected is a constant differential within this very localized, yet globally interconnected, broad and complex study. It's something that's fascinated me for years during my studies of cybernetics and system dynamics. Here is a list of other subjects I've intimately studied in no particular order - Medicine, Social Civil & Political Sciences, Computer Science, Fine Arts, Music, Anthropology, Philosophy, Theology, Linguistics, Phonetics, Literature, Comedy, History, Advertising in Psychology, Sound Design, Production in Multimedia, Telecommunications and Radio Science, Learning Theory, Business, Religion, Law, Mycology, Dendrology, General Field Identification and Foraging, Technology in Research and Development, Economics, Therapy, Hypnosis, Auto-Hypnosis, Security, Systems Theory, Civil and Social Engineering, Data, Reverse Engineering, Theoretical Physics, Metaphysics, Quantum Mechanics and Current Social Affairs.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for like-minded people who aren't religiously toxic. I look for people who push the boundaries of literature, classical method and theory. As a programmer, I would love to read your code. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are. As a businessman, I am always looking for quality and talented people to work with. If I were to run for a position in a field of governance, I would seek to propagate balanced and pragmatic leadership in order to oppose stagnation in legislative idiosynchronicities, albiet the political spectrum of our current sphere of political quandaries can seem unfathomable. In such regards, I'm personally conflicted in such matters and couldn't reasonably justify entering the field of politics.
