- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @lst-c0ast-studios 

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in positive and beneficial social connections! I am an audio engineer who enjoys writing, practices professional illusions, occasionally writes code, runs a paid service for audio dubs, mixing & mastering, audio remixes, audio edits, general performance booking, instrumental performances, promotions, photography, art, comics, security and many other things! I am also an author and I am currently working on some books at the moment. Here is a list of subjects I've intimately studied in no particular order - Traditional Medicine, Social Civil & Political Sciences, Computer Science, Arts and Music, Anthropology, Philosophy, Theology, Linguistics, Transliteration and Translation, Phonetics, Literature, Comedy, History, Advertising in Psychology, Sound Design, Production in Multimedia, Telecommunications and Radio Science, Learning Theory, Business, Law, Mycology, Dendrology, General Field Identification and Foraging, Technology in Research and Development, Economics, Therapy, Hypnosis, Auto-Hypnosis, Infrastructure, Neuroscience, Cyber-Security, Systems Theory, Civil and Social Engineering, Reverse Engineering, Theoretical Physics, Metaphysics, Quantum Mechanics, Current Social Affairs...on another note, I like to think about popularized fictional characters in well funded media and how their character lines can be related to services sold as business solutions if you apply portions of relevant applied anagrams in a search engine and how those searches impact education[1]. As shallow pervading philosophies that support the excessive acquisition of material belongings actively work towards the common objectification of human beings, what can be done to benefit humanity and how can we as people work towards a better future for all?. [1]I.E. "I am groot" = I AMG ROOT = AMG. What is AMG? Maybe use a search engine instead of "reaching out with your feelings" or as I like to put it, "asking without doing the research first".

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about hyperdimensional communications sub-systems and the roles they play in socio-economic, civil and military, applied research, multimedia outlets, development in education and legislative progression within the people's practical application and their functionalities of my relative and distant locale - as well as the impact those roles and ideas have on international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for like-minded individuals who aren't "religiously toxic". As a writer, I look for people who push the boundaries of literature, grammar and classical methodologies in linguistic morphology & syntax. As an artist I look for soul and real meaning in human interaction. As a programmer, I want to read your code and study your personal methods. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are.
