- 👋 Hi, I’m A.D.C. I work at and own a small portable art studio @lst-c0ast-studios. I'm currently in the process of designing a series of languages that have different purposes. Mainly for offline information encryption. I'm here mainly for study. Here are some other links https://linktr.ee/lst_c0ast_studios

- 👀 I’m interested in positive and beneficial social connections. I'm a professional audio engineer. When I'm not writing, I run a service dedicated to audio & video. We do hardware and software setups & takedowns. Repairs, custom design, testing, audio dubbing, edits, mixing, mastering, booking and so on. We have dedicated sessions musicians and network with many bright, multi-faceted and talented individuals.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about hyperdimensional communications systems and what roles they have and how they impact socio-economic development, multimedia design, civil and military infrastructure, education and legislation. I've found how hyperdimensional communications affect the complex nature of morphology contained therein the english lexicon of my relative and distant locale to be stunning. How international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium are affected is a constant differential within this very broad and complex study.

- 💞️ I’m looking for like-minded people who aren't religiously toxic. As a writer, I look for people who push the boundaries of literature, classical method and theory. As a programmer, I want to read your code. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are! As a businessman, I am always looking for quality and talented people to work with! If I were to run for a position in a field of governance, I would seek to propagate balanced and pragmatic leadership in order to oppose stagnation in legislative idiosynchronicities.
