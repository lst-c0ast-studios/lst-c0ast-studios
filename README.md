- 👋 Hi, I’m @lst-c0ast-studios

- 👀 I’m interested in positive and beneficial social connections!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about hyperdimensional communications sub-systems and the roles they play in socio-economic, 
-   civil and military, technological, multimedia and legislative functionalities within my relative locale - as well as the impact those roles have on
-   international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium.

- 💞️ I’m looking for like-minded individuals who aren't "religiously toxic"

- 📫 Message me @ lst_c0ast_studios#9976 on discord for business inquiries.
