- 👋 Hi, I’m @lst-c0ast-studios 

- 👀 I’m interested in positive and beneficial social connections! I do audio engineering, writing, professional illusions, some coding, live audio dubs, mixing & mastering, audio remixes, audio edits, general booking, instrumental performance, promotions, photography, art, comics, security and many other things! I am also an author and I am currently working on some books at the moment. Here is a list of subjects I've studied (no particular order) - Traditional Medicine Studies, Social Civil & Political Sciences, Computer Science, Arts and Music, Anthropology, Philosophy, Theology, Linguistics, Transliteration and Translation, Phonetics, Literature, Comedy, History, Advertising in Psychology, Sound Design, Production in Multimedia, Telecommunications and Radio Science, Learning Theory, Business, Law, Mycology, Dendrology, General Field Identification and Foraging, Technology in Research and Development, Economics, Therapy, Hypnosis, Auto-Hypnosis, Infrastructure, Neuroscience, Cyber-Security, System Theory, Civil and Social Engineering, Reverse Engineering, Theoretical Physics, Metaphysics, Quantum Mechanics, Current Social Affairs...on another note, I like to think about popularized fictional characters in well funded media and how their character lines can be strangely related to services sold as business solutions if you apply portions of the relevant applied anagrams in a search engine and how it usually ends up referring to the common objectification of human beings over material objects and how that all can be related to cambridge's current definition of fetishization. I.E. "I am groot" = I AMG ROOT = AMG. What is AMG? Maybe use a search engine instead of "reaching out with your feelings" or as I like to put it, "asking without doing the research first"

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about hyperdimensional communications sub-systems and the roles they play in socio-economic, civil and military, technological, multimedia and legislative functionalities within my relative locale - as well as the impact those roles have on international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium.

- 💞️ I’m looking for like-minded individuals who aren't "religiously toxic"
