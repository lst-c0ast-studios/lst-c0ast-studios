- üëã Hi, I work at and own a small independent portable studio called lst_c0ast_studios. That's pronounced "Last Coast Studios" in case you were wondering. I'm currently in the process of developing a language for use in information and cryptography. I am a tester on all grounds, i.e. web design, infrastructure, security, usability, practical applications, systems, networks and so on. I started an account on github to welcome open interaction and to have a semi organized grounds for study. This is not the only place I've come to explore and interact with. I have experience with advanced hardware and software that I would love to talk about if you have the time. I'm also an artist and a professional audio engineer. When I'm not writing, I run a service dedicated to audio. We do hardware as well as software setups & takedowns. Repairs, custom design, testing, live audio dubbing, post-production, ghostwriting, edits, mixing, mastering, booking, radio and so on. We have dedicated sessions musicians and network with many bright, multi-faceted and talented individuals. Here is a link to my other web pages https://linktr.ee/lst_c0ast_studios

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in positive and mutually beneficial social connections that can bring about positive change for all parties involved.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about hyperdimensional communications systems, what roles they have in society, how they impact socio-economic development, multimedia design, civil and military infrastructure, education and legislation. On that note, I've found that hyperdimensional communications affect the complex nature of morphology contained therein the english lexicon of my relative and distant locale. How international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium are affected is a constant differential within this very localized, yet globally interconnected, broad and complex study.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for like-minded people who aren't religiously toxic. I look for people who push the boundaries of literature, classical method and theory. As a programmer, I want to read your code. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are. As a businessman, I am always looking for quality and talented people to work with. If I were to run for a position in a field of governance, I would seek to propagate balanced and pragmatic leadership in order to oppose stagnation in legislative idiosynchronicities, albiet the political spectrum of our current sphere of political quandaries can seem unfathomeble as it's a true struggle for anyone who pay's attention to such issues.
