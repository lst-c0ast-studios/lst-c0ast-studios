- üëã Hi, I work at and own a small independent portable studio called lst_c0ast_studios. That's pronounced "Last Coast Studios" in case you were wondering. I am also a private developer. I am working on a book at the moment as well as deeply involved the process of developing a few languages for use in information and cryptography. The languages* have been in a rigorous testing phase with a focus on neurological aspects such as human memory and they have been designed with the goal of information being unattainable by any third-party even if such a third party has access to the key, code or even the assistance of utilizing an electronic interface that is designed to read the human mind's neurological activity i.e. methods such as an EEG scan. I've been able to accomplish these tests utilizing an experimental brain-to-computer interface designed with a feedback loop being output into various systems. The process of information integration and code development is an integral part of the encryption process - which I will elaborate upon in my upcoming publication on the development of these languages.

- I test many other things on my own time for private research i.e. web design, infrastructure, security, various systems, networks and so on.

- *see ex.A & ex.B within this repository for a small example of my work.

- I started an account on github to welcome open interaction and have a grounds for other studies. I have experience with advanced hardware and software that I would love to talk about if you have the time. I'm also an artist and a professional audio engineer. When I'm not writing or working on developing code, I run a service dedicated to audio. Custom hardware builds, setups and takedowns, repairs, testing, live audio dubbing, post-production, ghostwriting, edits, mixing, mastering, booking, radio and so on. I network with many dedicated sessions musicians, artists, programmers and a multitude of very bright, multi-faceted and talented individuals. Here is a link to my other web pages https://linktr.ee/lst_c0ast_studios

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in positive and mutually beneficial connections that can bring about positive change for all parties involved.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about hyperdimensional communications systems, what roles they have in society, how they impact socio-economic development, multimedia design, civil and military infrastructure, as well as education and legislation. On that note, I've found that hyperdimensional communications affect the complex nature of morphology contained therein the english lexicon of my relative and distant locale. How international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium are affected is a constant differential within this very localized, yet globally interconnected, broad and complex study. It's something that's fascinated me for years during my studies of cybernetics and system dynamics. 
 
- Here is a list of other subjects I've intimately studied in no particular order 

- Medicine, Social Civil & Political Sciences, Computer Science, Fine Arts, Music, Anthropology, Philosophy, Theology, Linguistics, Phonetics, Literature, Comedy, History, Advertising in Psychology, Sound Design, Production in Multimedia, Telecommunications and Radio Science, Learning Theory, Business, Law, Mycology, Dendrology, General Field Identification and Foraging, Technology in Research and Development, Economics, Therapy, Hypnosis, Auto-Hypnosis, Security, Cyber Security, System Design, Civil and Social Engineering, Reverse Engineering, Metaphysics, Quantum Mechanics and Current Social Affairs.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for like-minded people who aren't religiously toxic. I look for people who push the boundaries of literature, classical method and theory. As a programmer, I would love to read your code. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are. As a businessman, I am always looking for quality and talented people to work with. If I were to run for a position in a field of governance, I would seek to propagate balanced and pragmatic leadership in order to oppose stagnation in legislative idiosynchronicities, albiet the political spectrum of our current sphere of political quandaries can seem unfathomable. In such regards, I'm personally conflicted in such matters and couldn't reasonably justify entering the field of politics.
