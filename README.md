- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Yokiri, I work and own @lst-c0ast-studios. There are many services offered, all service comes with different premiums and price points, depending on what is available. Right now, we are offering audio mixing mastering for $200/min/track.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in positive and beneficial social connections! I study morphology and I'm an audio engineer who enjoys writing, practices professional illusions, occasionally writes code, runs a paid service for audio dubs, mixing & mastering, audio remixes, audio edits, general performance booking, instrumental performances, promotions, photography, art, comics, security and many other things! I am also an author and I am currently working on some books at the moment. Here is a list of subjects I've intimately studied in no particular order - Traditional Medicine, Social Civil & Political Sciences, Computer Science, Arts and Music, Anthropology, Philosophy, Theology, Government, Linguistics, Transliteration and Translation, Phonetics, Literature, Comedy, History, Advertising in Psychology, Sound Design, Production in Multimedia, Telecommunications and Radio Science, Learning Theory, Business, Law, Mycology, Dendrology, General Field Identification and Foraging, Technology in Research and Development, Economics, Therapy, Hypnosis, Auto-Hypnosis, Infrastructure, Neuroscience, Cyber-Security, Systems Theory, Civil and Social Engineering, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, Theoretical Physics, Current Social Affairs...on another note, I'd like to take this moment in time to express my detestation for the shallow pervading philosophies that support the excessive acquisition of material belongings that actively work towards the common objectification of human beings. What can be done to benefit humanity and how can we as people work towards a better future for every person? On another note, if I were to run for a position in the field of governance, I would seek to propagate balanced and pragmatic leadership in order to oppose stagnation in legislative idiosynchronicities within various branches and divisions.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about hyperdimensional communications sub-systems and the roles they have in socio-economic, multimedia outlets, civil and military research developments as well as how they affect education and legislation for the people's practical application and how these practices' functionalities affect the complex nature of morphology within the sub-categorization contained therein the english lexicon of my relative and distant locale. How international policies within the context of our world's modern geo-political equilibrium are affected is a constant differential within this very broad and complex study.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for like-minded individuals who aren't "religiously toxic". As a writer, I look for people who push the boundaries of literature, grammar and classical methodologies in morphology & syntax. As an artist I look for soul and real meaning in human interaction. As a programmer, I want to read your code and study your personal methods. As a person, I would love to get to know you for who you are and spend meaningful time with you if we're compatible. As a freelancer and businessman, I am always looking for quality people to work with, who respect ethics and understand an individual's needs. If you can make a sale, I might be interested in hearing from you.
